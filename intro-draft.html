<p>
So I finally have a bachelor's thesis topic - my task is to create
a full-stack web framework for Haskell, and I have maybe eight months
to do it (from now to the middle of May 2019).
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-1"><span class="section-number-3">1.1</span> How did I get here?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
<p>
I've been looking for a suitable topic for a while now. I knew I wanted
something challenging - but not Ph.D.-level challenging. I also wanted to work
in Haskell - but that's a mostly unknown topic at my uni. I needed a topic where
I could present something as my own work at the end, together with a theoretical
background - if I worked on an existing open-source project, I'd need
significant results and the theory to back it up.
</p>

<p>
I went through a long list of topics from GSoC topic suggestions from previous
years to 'Next work' sections of recent research papers. I found a lot of
challenging topics (incremental GC for GHC was the first topic I investigated),
a lot of practical-but-too-small topics, and a few topics of just the right size
and in interesting areas, but I kept postponing and waiting for just the right
topic.
</p>

<p>
The right topic appeared as a byproduct of my personal projects, Haskell
websites (Yesod, Scotty, and some others). Maybe a year ago, I needed to create
an interactive web interface. The obvious solution would be to use technologies
I knew (React.js or Angular), but I'd gotten tired of writing JavaScript at my
day job. I had my eyes on GHCJS and related projects for quite some time, so
this was the perfect opportunity.
</p>

<p>
There are several frameworks built on GHCJS, but out of them I liked Reflex the
most. (I guess part of the reason I chose it over the others was the added
novelty and challenge of FRP, oh well&#x2026;) But however much I liked it, it became
obvious that there are a lot of things missing in Reflex and reflex-platform,
that are present in most of the batteries-included JavaScript frameworks,
</p>

<p>
After a pause, I'd returned to my Reflex projects over the holidays, and I saw
my perfect bachelor's thesis topic. It needed to be refined, of course, but the
basis was there. I've looked for inspiration in other frameworks and found
Meteor.js among others, which was the very close to what I'd imagined the result
of my thesis to be. Another topic I saw references all over was the concept of a
Progressive Web Application (PWA), and that tied my topic together.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-2"><span class="section-number-3">1.2</span> What will I do then?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
<p>
Meteor.js is a full-stack platform in a quite wide sense of the word. It takes
care of everything from the data layer, through back-end and front-end
implementations, to the communication layer. There is a lively community around
it and an ecosystem in which I didn't find any obvious holes (great tooling,
libraries covering many concerns, &#x2026;).
</p>

<p>
As for PWAs, it's mostly a Google-created buzzword that consists of a 'PWA
checklist' and a few related tools. It captures recent trends in mobile and web
application and tries to remove the line between them, with offline capabilities
or push notifications.
</p>

<p>
I'd been especially interested in one item on the PWA checklist - 'offline
capabilities'. That's a hard topic and looking at some PWAs, I didn't like the
application-specific protocols some used, nor the opaque and sometimes
error-prone libraries used by others.
</p>

<p>
I'd like to focus on two things in my project: tooling that a developer from
the JavaScript world would take for granted - a framework-specific debugger,
profiler/benchmark tool, and testing tooling; and a full-stack data engine, from
database integration to non-opaque synchronization.
</p>

<p>
I'll need to focus for two reasons. One, I have <b><b>only</b></b> eight months, in which
I'll be working on this for maybe ten hours a week, which amounts to some 500h -
and that isn't much. Two, I've recently discovered Obelisk by Obsidian Systems,
which is a tool trying to tie up the loose ends left by reflex-platform
(e.g. deployment) and to build upon that ('isomorphic rendering'). At this
moment, I doubt I'll use it in my work as it's still a work-in-progress and I
wouldn't consider it stable, but I'd like to build my work so that it can be
used with Obelisk after my thesis is finished.
</p>

<p>
In the next post, I'll have a look at other web frameworks in detail, and try to
identify the must-haves and nice-to-haves of such a framework. Then I'll try to
map it onto the Haskell/GHCJS/Reflex ecosystem, to see what's missing.</p>
